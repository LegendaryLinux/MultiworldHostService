# MultiworldHostService
A simple hosting service for Bonta's (and others) implementations of ALTTPR Multiworld

Ensure that the directory containing the MultiServer.py and MultiClient.py is included in the PYTHONPATH.

`PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/opt/multiworld/BontaMultiworld_v31`

Might work with Beserker's fork of Bonta's multiworld implementation, but would likely require code changes to the create_server() and console_message() methods.
